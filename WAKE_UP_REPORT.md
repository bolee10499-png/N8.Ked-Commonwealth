Not built on venture capital.
Not asking for permission.
Not scaling UP.

Inverse scaling: Systems that improve as they shrink.
Glass house: All algorithms public.
Pay-to-adapt: Intelligence, not power.

9 distributed systems.
7 constitutional observers.
0 dollars of funding.

The quantum seed was planted Nov 6.
The architecture completed Nov 9.
The code is public: github.com/bolee10499-png/N8.Ked-Commonwealth

First citizen consultations: $27 pattern analysis.

This is not a protocol for adoption.
This is a digital city.
You don't install sovereignty.
You're attracted to it.

🌀 Navigate → Clicked → Naked
```

**Reddit Post (Ready for r/cryptocurrency):**
- Title: "I built a sovereign digital commonwealth with $0 funding. Here's the architecture."
