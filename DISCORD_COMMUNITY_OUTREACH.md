# Discord Community Outreach - Post-Launch Targets

**When to deploy:** After Twitter + Reddit gain initial traction (50+ upvotes or 100+ followers)

---

## Tier 1: High-Alignment Communities (Post First)

### 1. Web3 Architecture Discord Servers

**a) The Graph - Indexing Protocol**
- Server: https://discord.gg/graphprotocol
- Pitch angle: "Inverse-scaling indexing - metadata economy"
- Channel: #showcase or #general
- Message: "Built a sovereign digital nation with 7-observer pattern detection. Glass house transparency + inverse scaling. Anyone experimenting with unconventional architectures?"

**b) Ocean Protocol - Data Sovereignty**
- Server: https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5
- Pitch angle: "Data sovereignty + pay-to-adapt economy"
- Channel: #general or #data-economy

## Tier 2: DAO & Governance Communities

**a) Aragon - DAO Infrastructure**
- Server: https://discord.gg/aragon
- Pitch angle: "Reputation-weighted governance + constitutional voice"
- Channel: #governance or #showcase

**b) Snapshot - Governance Tooling**
- Server: https://discord.gg/snapshot
- Pitch angle: "Dust-backed voting with thermodynamic economy"
- Channel: #general or #show-and-tell

## Tier 3: Crypto Economics Communities

**a) Gitcoin - Public Goods Funding**
- Server: https://discord.gg/gitcoin

## Posting Strategy

### Timing
- **Delay:** Wait 3-6 hours after Twitter/Reddit launch
- **Spacing:** 1-2 servers per hour (avoid spam detection)
- **Peak hours:** 10am-2pm EST, 6pm-9pm EST (weekdays)

### Message Structure
1. **Hook:** "Built/Launched/Deployed [compelling thing]"
2. **Value prop:** What makes it unique for THIS community
3. **Proof:** Link to GitHub or live Discord
4. **Question:** Invite discussion, don't just announce

### Engagement Protocol
- **Respond within 15 minutes** to first replies
- **Answer technical questions** with constitutional honesty
- **Offer free analysis** to first 3 inquiries per server
- **Don't spam invite links** - let them ask

### Red Flags to Avoid
- ❌ "Revolutionary" or "game-changing" language
- ❌ Token price speculation
- ❌ Marketing speak or hype
- ❌ Cross-posting identical messages (customize per server)
- ❌ Invite link spam

### Green Flags to Emphasize
- ✅ Open source repository link
- ✅ Technical architecture details
- ✅ Constitutional principles
- ✅ Zero funding / bootstrapped story
- ✅ Live demonstration availability

## Community-Specific Messages (Templates)

### For DAO/Governance Servers
```
Hey! Just launched a sovereignty experiment: reputation-gated governance where 
higher trust = more access. Not token-weighted voting - contribution-weighted.

Herald (our constitutional oracle) testifies to observable fact instead of 
persuading votes. All proposals public, all votes logged, treasury democratically 
controlled.

GitHub: [link]
Live Discord: [link]

Anyone here working on non-token governance? Would love to compare notes.
```

### For Developer Servers
```
Shipped a sovereign digital nation in 9 days - full tech stack:
• 7-observer cognitive system (Input/Pattern/Memory/Simulation/Identity/Economy/Coordination)
• Triple helix self-healing (State/Action/Sync strands)
• Multi-chain wallet federation (Solana/Eth/BTC/XRP)
• Herald constitutional oracle
• 35+ database tables (SQLite with WAL mode)

Zero funding. All code public. Working Discord bot.

GitHub: [link]

What's the craziest thing you've built under constraints?
```

### For Economics/DeFi Servers
```
Experimenting with thermodynamic currency design:

FRAG (dust economy):
• 2% burn on every transfer (deflationary)
• Water backing (physical resource anchor, not algorithmic)
• Gravity Well (passive UBI - redistributes fees to users < threshold)
• Daily ritual (!bite) for base income

Not trying to be a stablecoin. Trying to be HONEST money that reflects 
energy expenditure.

Live in Discord: [link]
Whitepaper equivalent: [GitHub link]

Curious what breaks if we stress test this with you all.
```

### For Infrastructure Servers
```
Built inverse-scaling architecture:

Database: 0.0097ms avg response (10,000 concurrent operations)
Herald: Sub-millisecond testimony generation
Security: 5-role consensus in <100ms

Constraint: Everything runs on single Discord bot instance.

Why? Testing if "scaling" means efficiency, not size.

What's your most counter-intuitive performance optimization?

## Success Metrics

**Per server:**
- 5+ meaningful replies = Success
- 1+ DM inquiry = Strong signal
- 0 replies but upvotes/reactions = Decent awareness
- Negative reactions = Wrong fit (that's okay)

**Overall campaign:**
- 50+ total engaged users across all servers
- 10+ GitHub stars from Discord traffic
- 5+ new Discord server members
- 3+ pattern analysis consultation bookings

---

## Engagement Follow-Up

**If someone asks "What is this?"**
→ "It's a sovereign digital nation. Think DAO + identity layer + economic rails, but built from constitutional first principles instead of DeFi primitives. All code public, all algorithms observable. You can join the Discord and try /explore or /reputation commands to see it live."

**If someone asks "How do I get involved?"**
→ "Three paths: 1) Join Discord and explore (free), 2) Book $27 pattern analysis consultation to see architecture applied to your project, 3) Contribute code/ideas on GitHub. No tokens to buy, no whitelist, no gatekeeping."

**If someone asks "What's the business model?"**
→ "Pay-to-adapt economics: We sell processed intelligence, not power. $27 consultations (entry tier), $15k architecture reviews (enterprise). No ICO, no VC, no token presale. Sovereign sustainability."

**If someone is skeptical:**
→ "Healthy skepticism appreciated. The code is public, the Discord bot is live, the architecture is documented. Test it, break it, critique it. Glass house transparency means we welcome interrogation."

## Communities to AVOID

**Don't post in:**
- Pure meme/shitcoin communities (misaligned incentives)
- Influencer-focused servers (extractive culture)
- "Get rich quick" trading communities
- Overly promotional/spam-heavy servers
- Any server with "no self-promotion" rules (respect boundaries)

**Why avoid?**
These communities won't attract citizens - they'll attract tourists. We want builders, thinkers, and sovereigns. Not speculators.

---

**Next Steps After Outreach:**
1. Monitor replies across all servers
2. Respond constitutionally (honest, technical, helpful)
3. Invite engaged users to Discord
4. Track which servers convert to citizens
5. Double down on high-signal communities

The Herald's voice travels through authentic alignment, not broadcast reach.
