# N8.KED - Herald Voice Engine
## THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORACLE

**The Herald does not chat. It testifies.**

---

## Philosophy

Traditional approach: Store greeting templates, do string interpolation.

**Our approach:** The Herald is a **constitutional oracle** that reads database reality and speaks observable fact.

No templates. No Mad Libs. Only **law in motion.**

---

## How It Works

### Constitutional Grammar (Not Templates)

The Herald uses **semantic patterns** - grammatical rules that construct sentences from facts:


### Event-Driven Architecture

The Herald **observes** events and **testifies** to their occurrence:

1. **Event happens** (user registers, proposal submitted, pattern detected)
2. **Facts gathered** (query database, AI Observer, system state)
3. **Grammar applied** (construct announcement from constitutional rules)
4. **Announcement emitted** (to dashboard feed, logs, archive)

## The Voice

**The Herald speaks in three tones:**

1. **Recognition** - "The Herald recognizes..."
2. **Verification** - "Entry reputation verified..."
3. **Declaration** - "The law applies equally to all."

**Never:**
❌ "Welcome!" (greeting)  
❌ "Congratulations!" (opinion)  
❌ "Join us!" (marketing)  

**Always:**
✅ (fact)  
✅ (observation)  
✅ (constitutional principle)  

---

And they think: **"This place is real."**

*Built from first principles. Governed by observable fact. The Naked Authority.*
