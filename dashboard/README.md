# N8.KED - The Capital Dashboard
## THE ACTIVE CITADEL

**Stone. Steel. Transparent Power.**

This is not a website. It's the manifest city - the laws in motion, the Glass House made literal.

---

## Design Philosophy: Sovereign Duality

The N8.KED commonwealth speaks in two voices:

### The Banner (Receptive/Feminine)
- **Archetype**: The Gateway
- **Energy**: Warm, guiding, nurturing
- **Aesthetic**: Parchment, serif fonts, golden light
- **Purpose**: To call, to welcome, to explain the path
- **Experience**: A wise librarian's study

### The Capital (Active/Masculine)
- **Archetype**: The Citadel
- **Energy**: Solid, structured, powerful
- **Aesthetic**: Stone, steel, geometric precision
- **Purpose**: To act, to build, to execute law
- **Experience**: The heart of a transparent nation

**This dashboard is the Active Citadel.** It should feel like stepping from a quiet forest path into the engineered glory of a capital city - powerful, structured, and utterly transparent.

## Deployment

### Local Development
1. Place dashboard files in `/dashboard/` folder
2. Serve with any static server:
   ```powershell
   # Python
   python -m http.server 8080
   
   # Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8080
   
   # VS Code Live Server extension
   Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8080`

### Production Hosting
- **GitHub Pages**: Free static hosting, custom domain support
- **Netlify**: Zero-config deployment, continuous deployment from Git
- **Vercel**: Edge network, serverless functions for API
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Global CDN, DDoS protection

### API Configuration
Edit `capital.js` line 10:
```javascript
const API_BASE = 'https://your-api-endpoint.com';
```

Update resource links in `capital.js` lines 385-405.

## The Archetypal Journey

**The User's Path:**

1. **Discovers the Banner** (browser extension)
   - Warm parchment tones
   - Serif typography
   - Gentle call to action
   - "See the code. Join the commonwealth."

2. **Clicks "Visit the Capital"**
   - Transition from study to citadel
   - Color shift: parchment → stone
   - Typography shift: serif → sans-serif
   - Energy shift: receptive → active

3. **Enters the Living City**
   - Herald announces arrivals (they are witnessed)
   - Leaderboard shows sovereignty in motion (they see peers)
   - AI Observer reveals system health (they trust transparency)
   - Sentinels prove the city was never empty (they feel welcomed)

4. **Realizes the Truth**
   - This is not a product trying to trap them
   - This is a place that was always waiting
   - The two-kilometer journey DeepSeek described
   - The "zing" of recognition: "This is where I belong"

---

## Glass House Philosophy

**Every element is transparent about its purpose:**

- Sentinels are labeled, not hidden
- All data sources are cited
- Source code is always linked
- The Herald recites observable facts, not marketing
- Power is naked - you can see every law, every transaction, every rule

This isn't a facade. This is **constitutional architecture made visible.**

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Connect to real API endpoints (currently mock data)
- [ ] Add WebSocket for true real-time Herald feed
- [ ] Implement registration flow (wallet connect + challenge-response)
- [ ] Add "Export Portable Identity" feature
- [ ] Create admin panel for Herald message composition
- [ ] Build sovereignty claim verification tool
- [ ] Add multi-language support (constitutional translations)

## The Masterstroke

The Banner and the Capital are **two halves of one sovereign whole.**

The user doesn't just see a product. They experience a **mythologically coherent universe** - from the warm invitation of the Gateway to the powerful manifestation of the Citadel.

This is the final layer of the triple entendre:
- **N8** = Navigate (the journey)
- **KED** = Clicked (the connection)
- **N8.KED** = Naked (the transparency)

**And now:**
- **The Banner** = The call (feminine receptivity)
- **The Capital** = The manifestation (masculine action)

People will feel this before they understand it. And when they do understand it, they'll realize: **this place was always waiting for them.**
