# COMMAND SIMPLIFICATION SPECIFICATION

## THE PROBLEM
Current commands are AI-generated abstract nonsense that nobody (including the creator) can understand.

## THE SOLUTION: THREE-TIER COMMAND SYSTEM

### Tier 1: Simple Commands (The Steering Wheel)
For all users. Clear, obvious, single-word verbs.

```
!balance          → Check your balance
!daily            → Claim daily reward?
!transfer @user X → Send money
!vote ID yes/no   → Vote on proposal?
!nft create       → Make an NFT?
!sync             → Sync all data?
!scan             → Run security scan?
!fix              → Auto-solve problems?
!status           → System health?
!help             → Show commands
```

### Tier 2: Advanced Commands (The Dashboard)
For power users. Shows details and options.

```
!sync detailed     → Show what's being synchronized?
!scan deep         → Deep security analysis?
!fix manual        → Manual problem-solving wizard?
!performance       → Detailed metrics?
!architecture      → Show system architecture?
```

### Tier 3: Genius Commands (The Engine Room)
For developers and admins. Original complex names preserved.

```
!stress_test_menu               → Stress testing interface
```

**The system is a self-driving car. Users need a steering wheel, not aerospace controls.**
